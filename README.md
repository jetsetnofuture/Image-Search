# Image Search

## What Does It Do
Image Search is a React app that uses the Unsplash API to display images that match the search term

## Motivation
* To learn the basic structure of a React page that pulls data from an API and displays it on the page

## Stack
* React
  * Using state and component-based development to make the correct images appear upon search
  * Refactoring the functionality of the api calls and search calls into separate components
* Node
  * Using the Unsplash API to grab images that match the search term 

## How to Use
* In the CLI, run "npm run start". The main page will be located on "localhost:3000"
* Enter the image search term in the box and hit Enter to display the Unsplash images

## To-Do List
