## How to Use
* In the CLI, run "npm run start". The main page will be located on "localhost:3000" or a similar available port.
* Enter the image serach term in the box and hit Enter to display the Unsplash images

## Things I Learned
* Using an API with a React based project (the Unsplash API to grab images based on the search term)
* Using the basics of state and component-based development to make the correct images appear upon search
* Refactoring code to separate functionality (such as the api call and search call) into separate components

## To-Do List
- [ ] Style the current components to improve the overall UI
- [ ] Add a "Search" button to go along with the Enter key
- [ ] Add more informational UI elements like the number of images found
